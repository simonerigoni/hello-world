\cvsect{Who Am I?}

\begin{minipage}[t]{0.5\textwidth} % 40% of the page width for the introduction text
	\vspace{-\baselineskip} % Required for vertically aligning minipages
	
	I graduated in Computer Engineering - Embedded and Control Systems at the University of Pavia in 2017. During my Erasmus Traineeship in Dublin I worked as Software Developer at Firmwave, a young company specialized in the design of low-power hardware for IoT. I got passionate about Business Intelligence, Machine Learning and Data Science so I decided to completely change my working field. I started working in 2017 as Technical Consultant at Aptos which operates a singular commerce platform that enables retail enterprises to deliver omni-channel shopping experiences to customers. In 2019 I graduated from the Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree Program. I write about Machine Learning and Data Science topics on \underline{\href{https://medium.com/@simone.rigoni01}{Medium}} and I have recently built my website \underline{\href{http://www.simonerigoni.net}{simonerigoni.net}} as a common platform for my projects
