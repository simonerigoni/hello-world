# Hello World

Hello, I am Simone Rigoni and graduated in Computer Engineering - Embedded and Control Systems at the [University of Pavia](http://wcm-3.unipv.it/site/en/home.html) in 2017. During my Erasmus Traineeship in Dublin I worked as intern at [Firmwave](https://iot.taoglas.com/), a young company specialized in the design of low-power hardware for IoT. I got passionate about Business Intelligence, Machine Learning and Data Science so I decided to completely change my working field

I started working in 2017 as Technical Consultant at [Aptos](https://www.aptos.com/) which operates a singular commerce platform that enables retail enterprises
to deliver omni-channel shopping experiences to customers. One key aspect of my work are the performances of the code because of the high volume of data that are involved in the retail related business processes

In 2019 I graduated from the Udacity Data ScientistbNanodegree Program. This course allowed me to deepen my theoretical and practical knowledge of Supervise, Unsupervised and Deep Learning. You can find all my projects here on GitHub
