# Hello World

I graduated in Computer Engineering - Embedded and Control Systems at the [University of Pavia](http://wcm-3.unipv.it/site/en/home.html) in 2017. During my Erasmus Traineeship in Dublin I worked as Software Developer at [Firmwave](https://iot.taoglas.com/), a young company specialized in the design of low-power hardware for IoT. I took part in the design and implementation Over the Air In Application Programming on a device based on MCU STM32F4 (equipped with ARM Cortex M4), implementing new features in both the bootloader in the application using C

I got passionate about Python and how to use data to solve problems so I decided to completely change my working field approaching Data Science

I started working in 2017 as Technical Consultant at [Aptos](https://www.aptos.com/) which operates a singular commerce platform that enables retail enterprises to deliver omni-channel shopping experiences to customers. One key aspect of my work are the performances of the code because of the high volume of data that are involved in the retail related business processes

In 2019 I graduated from the [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/) Data Scientist Nanodegree Program. Very useful course that allowed me to deepen my theoretical and practical knowledge of Supervise, Unsupervised and Deep Learning
