# Hello World

Hello my name is Simone Rigoni and I have graduated in Computer Engineering - Embedded and Control Systems at the University of Pavia in 2017. During my Erasmus Traineeship in Dublin I worked as intern at Firmwave, a young company specializing in the design of low-power hardware.

I currently work in Milan at Aptos, Inc. which operates a singular commerce platform that enables retail enterprises to deliver omni-channel shopping experiences to customers. I am Technical Consultant and I mainly deal with the development of T-SQL functionalities like stored procedure and scripts of various nature and batches for the execution of automatic tasks. One key aspect of my work are the performances of the code because of the high volume of data that are involved in the retail related business processes. 

I am very passionate about Software Development and Python is the language I prefer to work with.

In 2019 I graduated from the Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree Program wich aims to improve all theoretical and practical skills needed to develop Supervise, Unsupervised and Deep Learning algorithm. The projects carried out during the nanodegree were rather challenging and helped me to test and increase my knowledge and passion in this field. You can find all my projects here on GitHub.
