# Hello World

Hello my name is Simone Rigoni and I have graduated in Computer Engineering - Embedded and Control Systems at the University of Pavia in 2017. During my Erasmus Traineeship in Dublin I worked as intern at Firmwave, a young company specializing in the design of low-power hardware.
I am very passionate about Software development and now I am really interested in Machine Learning.
